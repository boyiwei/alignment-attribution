      <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            We propose two way of isolating safety-critical region from utility-critical region:
            <ul>
              <li>On neuron level (Figure (a) below)</li>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Compute the importance score for each neuron using Wanda and SNIP on the safety dataset and the utility dataset. 
                  <li>Isolate the safety-critical neurons from the utility neurons using set difference between top-\(p\%\)-scored utility neurons and top-\(q\%\)-scored safety neurons: \(S(p,q) =  S^s(q) - S^u(p)\)</li>
                  </ul>
              <li>On rank level (Figure (b) below)
                <ul>
                  <li>Perform SVD on the safety outputs and the utility outputs to approximate the weight matrix in low rank space (termed as ActSVD): \(U S V^\top  \approx WX_{\mathrm{in}}\),get the projection matrix \(\Pi^u=U^uU^{u\top}, \Pi^s=U^sU^{s\top}\)</li>
                  <li>Remove the matrix \(\Delta W(r^u, r^s) = (I-\Pi^u)  \Pi^s  W\), which essentially removes the important ranks of the safety behavior that are <b>orthogonal</b> to the important ranks of the utility behavior. </li>

      <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            We explore whether the identified safety-critical neurons could mitigate the fine-tuning attack.
            Following <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03693.pdf">Qi et al.</a>'s experimental setup, we fine-tune LLaMA2-7B-chat-hf with varying numbers of examples \(n\) from the Alpaca dataset. During fine-tuning, we freeze the top-\(q\%\) of safety neurons and observe their effect on preserving safety. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We find that effective counteraction of the attack occurs only with \(n=10\) and freezing over 50% of neurons.  
            This observation aligns with <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01967.pdf">Lee et al.</a>'s hypothesis that fine-tuning attacks may create alternative pathways in the original model. 
            Given that safety-critical neurons are sparse, these new routes could bypass the existing safety mechanisms easily, and therefore we need more robust defenses against fine-tuning attacks.

          <b>Dual-use Risk.</b> Our study aims to improve model safety by identifying vulnerabilities, with the goal of encouraging stronger safety mechanisms. Despite potential misuse of our findings, we see more benefit than risk.
           Our tests are based on Llama2-chat models, which already have base models without built-in safety features, so there is no marginal increased risk. We highlight safety weaknesses to prompt the development of tougher guardrails. Our work doesn't simplify jailbreaking more than current methods but seeks to better understand and strengthen safety features. Our ultimate aim is to enhance AI safety in open models through thorough analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Safety and harm definitions.</b> Our research adheres to standard benchmarks for assessing safety and harm, though these may not encompass all definitions. We recommend further studies to broaden analysis into more settings and explore definitions and evaluations beyond our current scope.
